Title - Cowboy Game 

Short Description - A game where you play as a cowboy riding his horse, dodging the perils of the West.

What does the project do?
It is my first scratch project that was done out of pure enjoyment, it start of in a sallon and it plays 
western music in the background until the user presses A, making it switch to the actual game, where the
user is controlling the cowboy on the horse and for the first 30 seconds a cactus is zooming accross the 
desert, which the cowboy is trying to avoid. The game increases in difficultly with more items coming on
the screen. Until the cowboy dies from hiting one of the item and it changes to the death screen that 
plays another song.

How to tweak this project? 
I want to add another soundtrack in the second backdrop, but haven't figured out how to do it without 
the music overlapping with the final backdrop music
